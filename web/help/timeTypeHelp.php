<h2>Type</h2>
<p>The AWARE database contains two types of file representing the housekeeping data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple -- Summary files with one data point every 5 minutes</li>
<li>Full -- Files with one data point for each recorded housekeeping event, that is every 10 seconds for the sensor and every second for the event housekeeping.</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case only Max Plot Points are shown, and the data is averaged into this number of even sized bins.</p>
